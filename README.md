## What is it?
[GiphyTabs is a chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/giphy-tabs/dkajnomnlpcpkekglpbbhcmmgljadopo?hl=en-US) that replaces your new tab with random giphys. This is just some light modifications to that extension for now.

## TODO
* Make icons so I'm not stealing
* Get my own API key
* Release!
